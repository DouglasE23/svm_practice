# svm_practice
I've been working on some code cleanup of past projects and starting some new ones, but due to some technical and personal issues on my end these projects are taking longer than I would like to complete, especially since I am not focusing on one at a time.

As such, I decided it made sense to just upload some practice code to show that I am still coding and that I know how to do things.

The aim of this file is simple; this is me comparing three similar SVM models to determine which of the three is the most accurate with the Iris dataset.
